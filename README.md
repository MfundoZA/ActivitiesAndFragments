# ActivitiesAndFragments
A android project I created to understand the basics of creating an android app

# What I learned
* The general structure of how variables and Views are declared, initialized and referenced
* How to preserve variables and restore their values in case of configuration changes or system processes
* How to create and use on OverflowMenu in the AppBar
* How to navigate between activities
* How to navigate between fragments
